                        WebDollar is a browser based digital currency. The main advantages to it, are that WebDollars can be mined in your browser and you can transfer funds by storing the wallets locally, without using third parties.

                        WebDollar is a peer to peer (p2p) currency which is native to the internet. The WebDollar protocol and blockchain were designed to be light and to work without the installation of any additional software or plugins for wallets or mining. A mini-blockchain is downloaded directly into your browser, while your wallet is securely stored and encrypted directly into your computer. Full consensus is achieved in a matter of seconds by using a novel PPoW - Proofs of Proof of Work algorithm to allow light nodes to check the balance and validate transactions in a matter of seconds. Being native to the internet, WebDollar is enabling miners to start mining with a click of a button.

                        The potential balance is the approximation of your total balance at the next payout by the pool. This can vary greatly, because it's the proportion between your involved processing power and the total processing power of the network (which too, will vary).

EDUCATIONAL MOMENT: Unfortunately, cryptocurrency investors do tend to invest in tokens that have absolutely no backing other than a conceptual description. Over time, cryptocurrency investors unaware of this fact, have been investing huge amounts of money into these type of projects that have proven nothing else but good marketing skills. And therefore, the lack of technical developing skills of the teams behind those projects has lead to a dramatic price drop of the said coins or tokens which, in turn has left the investors high and dry, aka without their hard earned investment money.
