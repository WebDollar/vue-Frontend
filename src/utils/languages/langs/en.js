The WebDollar protocol and blockchain were designed to be light and to work without the installation of any additional software or plugins for wallets or mining. A mini-blockchain is downloaded directly into your browser, while your wallet is securely stored and encrypted directly into your computer.

            whatIsPotentialBalanceAnswer: `The potential balance is the approximation of your total balance at the next payout by the pool. This can vary greatly, because it's the proportion between your involved staking amount and the total staking amount of the network (which too, will vary).`,

Over time, cryptocurrency investors unaware of this fact, have been investing huge amounts of money into these type of projects that have proven nothing else but good marketing skills.
